            <p class="p">Why can we never say never?</p>
            <p>We cannot "never" say "never" because humans are unpredictable, situations change, and our perception of possibilities is limited, making absolute statements about the future unreliable. The phrase is an idiom encouraging optimism and flexibility, reminding us that what seems impossible today could be a reality tomorrow. </p>
            <p class="p">Examples of the idiom in action:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Someone might say they would "never get married," only to change their mind years later.</li> 

             <li>A business that seems destined to fail could, with a shift in strategy or market conditions, become successful. </li>

             <li>An individual who was once against a certain idea or lifestyle might later embrace it.</li> </ul>
