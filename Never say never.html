            <p class="p">"Never say never" who created this phrase?</p>
            <p>The phrase "Never say never" doesn't have a single known creator, though it's often mistakenly attributed to Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers. The phrase was in use in the late 19th century, with a 1911 song by Seymour Furth and other early 20th-century music hall songs using the expression, suggesting it was a popular idiom by then rather than a new invention. 
</p>
            <p class="p">Charles Dickens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>His writing includes books such as Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol - books that are still very widely read today. </li> 

             <li>He wrote about things that many people before him had avoided writing about, like the lives of poorer people. </li>

             <li>Charles Dickens is one of Britain's most famous authors.</li> </ul>
